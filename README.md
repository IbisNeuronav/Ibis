### Ibis Neuronav ###
The Intraoperative Brain Imaging System (Ibis) is an open source image-guided neurosurgery (IGNS) platform that replicates most of the basic functionality of it commercial counterparts while allowing for rapid development of new techniques. The platform focuses on intraoperative imaging such as tracked ultrasound and improved visualization throught the use of augmented reality.

Ibis was originally developed by [Simon Drouin](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/?page_id=369) and [Anka Kochanowska](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/?page_id=663) in the [NeuroImaging and Surgical Technologies lab](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca) at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](http://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/).
